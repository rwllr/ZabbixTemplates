A Zabbix template for monitoring Sonicwalls and SonicPoints. 
Interfaces and Sonicpoints are discovered automatically.
Requires SonicOS 6.5 or later for SonicPoint functionality.
Just import the XML as normal to get rolling!

Started with [this](https://share.zabbix.com/cat-app/firewall/sonicwall-tz400) template, but have modified so to use generic SNMP interface template so it autodiscovers all interfaces, not just manually added ones and works accross all models.

You can read more about this in my blog post [here](http://raphael.waller.biz/sonicpoint-monitoring-with-snmp-and-zabbix/).
